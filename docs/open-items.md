# Open items

As of 2026-10-27. Tick off, or move to `decisions.md` when settled. A bug that will be fixed goes
here; a limit or trap we live with goes in `known-issues.md`. Each item in one place only.

## Blockers

## Waiting on the user

- Guardian and NYT API keys in `.env` (`GUARDIAN_API_KEY`, `NYT_API_KEY`). Until then those
  two sources are built and tested from fixtures, but not backfilled.
  - NYT (Task 1.5) is left unticked: its fixture is hand-built from NYT's docs. Once the key
    exists, run one live month, check that `section_name` values match the filter (older
    years may differ), then tick. A backfill from 1990 is ~440 calls against a 500/day cap:
    split it over two days.
  - Guardian (Task 1.4) is left unticked: the public `test` key now returns 401, so the
    fixture is hand-built. Once the key exists, run the live probe, replace the fixture with a
    real response, confirm the earliest date and the developer-key limits, then tick.

- Google News RSS dropped: its robots.txt disallows /rss for every crawler. Brian may
  overrule the skip; the adapter would take about an hour to build.
- HKEXnews dropped: the HKEX Terms of Use (section 5) forbid scripted access and data mining.
  The helper read the terms through a summarising fetch, not the raw page. Brian could ask
  info@hkex.com.hk for written permission; until then HK filings are not collected.

## Pending work

- yfinance `Ticker.news` returns nothing (Yahoo's endpoint answers 404); the Yahoo adapter
  uses the `yf.Search` fallback. Re-check after a yfinance upgrade. Search finds no headlines
  for 2800.HK and 3033.HK; Task 2.2 decides whether they stay as price targets (they still
  have prices; only headlines are missing).
- RSS feeds (Task 1.10): 12 feeds kept on robots.txt grounds. Still to do: read the
  Investing.com and SCMP terms for bans on automated feed access; check whether Dow Jones
  terms allow MarketWatch feeds; find working Yahoo, Nasdaq and US Treasury feed URLs. Poll
  CISA (5.7 MB per fetch) at most every 15 minutes.

- News event module: see `docs/plans/2026-10-27-news-event-module.md`.
